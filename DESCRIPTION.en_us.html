<p>Barlow is a grotesk typeface that draws from the visual style of the California public -- its highway signs, car plates, busses, and trains. The typeface is named after internet pioneer, EFF co-founder, songwriter, and activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>, in tribute to his <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">lasting impact on the information superhighway</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to OTF, TTF, WOFF, and UFO font formats, Barlow is available as a GX variable font, giving designers the power to pick their own weights and widths. Included are 54 suggested styles - a roman and oblique for nine weights and three widths.</p>
<p>Barlow is designed by <a href="https://tribby.com/">Jeremy Tribby</a> and released under the SIL Open Font License. If you'd like to make a donation, please consider directing it to the <a href="https://www.johnperrybarlow-wellnesstrust.com/">John Perry Barlow Wellness Trust</a>.</p>
