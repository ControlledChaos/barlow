<p>Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast, grotesk type family designed by <a href="https://tribby.com/">Jeremy Tribby</a>. Drawing from the visual style of the California public, Barlow shares qualities with the state's car plates, highway signs, busses, and trains. The family includes 27 manually-hinted styles in three widths and nine weights, suitable for digital and print use at text and display sizes. Customizable weights and widths are available via the included variable font (OTVar/GX).</p>
<p>The typeface is named after internet pioneer, EFF co-founder, songwriter, and activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>, in tribute to his <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">lasting impact on the information superhighway</a>.
