# Barlow

Barlow draws from the visual style of the California public -- its highway signs, car plates, busses, and trains. The typeface is named after internet pioneer, EFF co-founder, songwriter, and activist John Perry Barlow, in tribute to his lasting [impact on the information superhighway](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).

Barlow is available as a GX variable font, giving a designer the power to pick their own weights and widths for the font. Included are 54 suggested styles in OTF, TTF, WOFF, and UFO format: a roman and oblique for nine weights and three widths.

Barlow is a free font, released under the SIL Open Font License. If you'd like to make a donation, please consider directing it to the [John Perry Barlow Wellness Trust](https://www.johnperrybarlow-wellnesstrust.com/).

## Download

[Download the project](https://github.com/jpt/barlow/archive/master.zip) and find the font in the `otf` directory. After downloading, a good way to play with it as a web font is on [Pablo Impallari's font testing site](http://www.impallari.com/testing/).
