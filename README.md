# Barlow

Barlow is a low-contrast, slightly rounded grotesk typeface designed by [Jeremy Tribby](https://tribby.com). It draws from the visual style of the California public -- its highway signs, car plates, busses, and trains. The typeface is named after internet pioneer, EFF co-founder, songwriter, and activist [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow), in tribute to his lasting [impact on the information superhighway](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).

In addition to OTF, TTF, WOFF, and UFO font formats, Barlow is available as a GX variable font, giving designers the power to pick their own weights and widths. Included are 54 suggested styles - a roman and oblique for nine weights and three widths.

Barlow is a free, libre font. If you'd like to make a donation, please consider directing it to the [John Perry Barlow Wellness Trust](https://www.johnperrybarlow-wellnesstrust.com/).

## Download

[Download the project](https://github.com/jpt/barlow/archive/master.zip) and find the font in the `fonts/otf` directory. After downloading, a good way to play with it as a web font is on [Pablo Impallari's font testing site](http://www.impallari.com/testing/).
