# Barlow

## A typeface for the information superhighway.

Barlow is named after activist, writer, and Internet pioneer John Perry Barlow. It is inspired by Highway Gothic, Interstate, DIN, and other public signage typefaces -- Barlow is meant to be a sign font for the Internet, the biggest highway of all.
